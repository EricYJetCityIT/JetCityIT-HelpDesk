# API Authorization

## Access model

| Capability | Who |
|---|---|
| **Submit** a ticket (`POST /api/tickets`) | Anyone — no sign-in. Rate-limited by IP (5/min) plus a honeypot field. |
| **View / list / update tickets, reply (staff console)** | Only accounts on the `STAFF_UPNS` allowlist |
| **View / reply to own tickets (client tracking page)** | Anyone holding a valid per-email access token — see below |

There is no intermediate "read-only staff" tier — being on `STAFF_UPNS` is the
entire access boundary for everything under `/api/tickets*` besides ticket
creation. Enforcement is server-side (in the Functions); the frontend hiding
the console for non-staff is a convenience, not the security boundary.

## Who is "staff"?

Same quick-start pattern as the crew-calendar app's `EDITOR_UPNS`: a
comma-separated allowlist app setting, checked against the signed-in user's
UPN (email). No app-registration change needed to add or remove someone.

```
STAFF_UPNS = dylanm@jetcityit.com,ericy@jetcityit.com,alex@jetcityit.com,simone@jetcityit.com
```

To add or remove staff: Static Web App (`jetcityit-helpdesk`) → **Configuration**
→ edit `STAFF_UPNS` → Save. Takes effect on the next request, no redeploy.

## Sign-in

Reuses the **same Azure AD App Registration** as the crew-calendar app
("JetCity Availability App", client id `b367d366-39f5-4fdc-a5e9-9d634ca37b5e`,
tenant `a2b534e7-8d8b-4c5f-ae4b-5076fd677ff4`) — just with additional SPA
redirect URIs registered for this site's origins (`/` and `/staff.html`, for
both the `*.azurestaticapps.net` default hostname and `helpdesk.jetcityit.com`).
No new app registration, no new admin consent.

## Client ticket tracking (`/track.html`, `api/client/*`)

Clients aren't `@jetcityit.com` accounts and ticket submission itself is
unauthenticated (no email verification), so ticket IDs and email addresses
alone can't serve as a secret — a ticket ID only has ~1.7M possible values
and is easily guessable. Instead, each client email gets one persistent
random access token (`api/src/lib/clientAccess.js`, stored in the `Tickets`
table under partition `CLIENT`), and that token is **only ever delivered by
emailing it to the address it belongs to** — never returned directly in an
API response. The real inbox owner is the only one who ever sees it, which
is what actually proves the requester controls that address.

The token rides along automatically:
- In the ticket-submission confirmation email (`POST /api/tickets`)
- In every staff-reply notification email (`POST /api/tickets/{id}/replies`)
- Or on request, via `POST /api/client/access {email}` from `/track.html`'s
  "track your tickets" form — always returns the same generic response
  whether or not that email has tickets, and is rate-limited both per-IP and
  per-target-email so it can't be used to spam a stranger's inbox.

`GET /api/client/tickets` and `GET /api/client/tickets/{id}` take `email` +
`token` query params, validate the token, and additionally re-check that the
ticket's own `email` field matches — so a valid token for one address can
never unlock a ticket filed under a different one, even by guessed ID.
`POST /api/client/tickets/{id}/replies` (`email`, `token`, `body`) lets the
client add to the thread; this reopens the ticket to `Open` if it wasn't
already, and best-effort emails a staff notification (to `helpdesk@`
itself, since staff already have it as a shared mailbox).

Client-facing responses omit internal fields (`assignee`, staff UPNs) —
staff messages are attributed simply to "Jet City IT Help Desk", not the
individual technician.

## Email notifications

A staff reply also emails the requester (from `helpdesk@jetcityit.com`, a
real shared mailbox with sign-in disabled — same setup pattern as the
crew-calendar app's shared mailboxes). Sending uses **app-only Microsoft
Graph** (`api/src/lib/graph.js`), reusing the same App Registration and its
already-admin-consented application `Mail.Send` permission — no new consent
grant, just a `MAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` app setting (the same secret value used by
the crew-calendar app's availability-reminder job).

The reply itself is saved before the email is attempted, and sending is
best-effort: a failure is logged (`EMAIL_NOTIFY_FAILED` in the Function's
logs) but never fails the reply request. The email carries the full reply
text plus a tracking-page link (see above), so the requester doesn't have
to go looking for it separately.

## Testing

- **Public**: submit a ticket with no auth → 201 with a `ticketId`. Submit
  with the hidden `website` field filled in → fake 201, nothing written.
  Hammer the endpoint > 5x/min from one IP → 429.
- **As staff** (in `STAFF_UPNS`): list tickets, open one, change status/priority/
  assignee, reply → all succeed.
- **As a signed-in but non-staff `@jetcityit.com` account**: `/api/me` returns
  `{isStaff:false}`; any `/api/tickets*` call → 403.
- **Email**: reply to a real ticket → requester gets an email from
  `helpdesk@jetcityit.com` with the reply text. Reply still succeeds (200)
  even if `MAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` is missing/wrong — check the Function's logs
  for `EMAIL_NOTIFY_FAILED` in that case.
- **Client tracking**: submit a ticket, click the link in the confirmation
  email → lands on `/track.html` already signed in, showing that ticket.
  Reply from there → status flips to Open (if it wasn't), staff gets a
  notification email, and the staff console shows the new message. Request
  a link for an email with no tickets → same generic `{ok:true}` response,
  no email sent. Try a tampered/guessed token → 403, page prompts to
  request a new link.
