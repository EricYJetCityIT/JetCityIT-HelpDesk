# API Authorization

## Access model

| Capability | Who |
|---|---|
| **Submit** a ticket (`POST /api/tickets`) | Anyone — no sign-in. Rate-limited by IP (5/min) plus a honeypot field. |
| **View / list / update tickets, reply** | Only accounts on the `STAFF_UPNS` allowlist |

There is no intermediate "read-only staff" tier — being on `STAFF_UPNS` is the
entire access boundary for everything under `/api/tickets*` besides ticket
creation. Enforcement is server-side (in the Functions); the frontend hiding
the console for non-staff is a convenience, not the security boundary.

## Who is "staff"?

Same quick-start pattern as the crew-calendar app's `EDITOR_UPNS`: a
comma-separated allowlist app setting, checked against the signed-in user's
UPN (email). No app-registration change needed to add or remove someone.

```
STAFF_UPNS = dylanm@jetcityit.com,ericy@jetcityit.com,alex@jetcityit.com,simone@jetcityit.com
```

To add or remove staff: Static Web App (`jetcityit-helpdesk`) → **Configuration**
→ edit `STAFF_UPNS` → Save. Takes effect on the next request, no redeploy.

## Sign-in

Reuses the **same Azure AD App Registration** as the crew-calendar app
("JetCity Availability App", client id `b367d366-39f5-4fdc-a5e9-9d634ca37b5e`,
tenant `a2b534e7-8d8b-4c5f-ae4b-5076fd677ff4`) — just with additional SPA
redirect URIs registered for this site's origins (`/` and `/staff.html`, for
both the `*.azurestaticapps.net` default hostname and `helpdesk.jetcityit.com`).
No new app registration, no new admin consent.

## Email notifications

A staff reply also emails the requester (from `helpdesk@jetcityit.com`, a
real shared mailbox with sign-in disabled — same setup pattern as the
crew-calendar app's shared mailboxes). Sending uses **app-only Microsoft
Graph** (`api/src/lib/graph.js`), reusing the same App Registration and its
already-admin-consented application `Mail.Send` permission — no new consent
grant, just a `MAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` app setting (the same secret value used by
the crew-calendar app's availability-reminder job).

The reply itself is saved before the email is attempted, and sending is
best-effort: a failure is logged (`EMAIL_NOTIFY_FAILED` in the Function's
logs) but never fails the reply request. There is no client-facing portal
yet, so the email carries the full reply text, not just a link.

## Testing

- **Public**: submit a ticket with no auth → 201 with a `ticketId`. Submit
  with the hidden `website` field filled in → fake 201, nothing written.
  Hammer the endpoint > 5x/min from one IP → 429.
- **As staff** (in `STAFF_UPNS`): list tickets, open one, change status/priority/
  assignee, reply → all succeed.
- **As a signed-in but non-staff `@jetcityit.com` account**: `/api/me` returns
  `{isStaff:false}`; any `/api/tickets*` call → 403.
- **Email**: reply to a real ticket → requester gets an email from
  `helpdesk@jetcityit.com` with the reply text. Reply still succeeds (200)
  even if `MAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` is missing/wrong — check the Function's logs
  for `EMAIL_NOTIFY_FAILED` in that case.
